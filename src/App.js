          It’s my pleasure to finally meet you. May I ask, how should I address
          you?
        </p>
        <p>Tom, what a wonderful name!</p>
        <p>
          As you've realized, our timelines haven’t fully aligned yet, which is
          why we can’t have a live conversation just yet.{" "}

        <p>
          But don’t worry, I’ve managed to transcode some of my diaries so you
          can tune in to my history.

          And before you go, remember that you can find more information about
          my universe by following my media.
